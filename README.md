# Multirack solution for Kubernetes cluster

This repo contains Ansible Cookbook, for configure existing 
k8s environment to multirack case.

Also Route Redistribution container stored here.

Ansible inventory for kargo should looks like:

```
[all]
node1    ansible_host=10.90.1.2 ip=10.90.1.2
node2    ansible_host=10.90.1.3 ip=10.90.1.3
node3    ansible_host=10.90.2.4 ip=10.90.2.4

[all:vars]
calico_network_backend="none"

.....

[rack1]
node1
node2

[rack1:vars]
  as_number=65001
  subnet=10.90.1.0/24
  tor=10.90.1.254
  bgpport=179
  rr_bgpport=180
  rack_no=1

[rack2]
node3

[rack2:vars]
  as_number=65002
  subnet=10.90.2.0/24
  tor=10.90.2.254
  bgpport=179
  rr_bgpport=190
  rack_no=2

# This group mapping required if your environment deployed by Kargo.
# If You use another deployment tool, or need more custom deployment
# please remove group mapping and list nodes into corresponded groups
# (like in commented example bellow)
# [bird-rr]
# node-1
# node-3
# [bird-node]
# node-2

[bird-rr:children]
kube-master

[bird-node:children]
kube-node
```

Deployment can be started by
```
ansible-playbook -i $INVENTORY ./cluster.yaml -e @/root/k8s_customization.yaml
```
Where `INVENTORY` may be inventory file or dynamic inventory from `vagrant-multirack`, `-e ...` is optional.

Route Redistribution container, implements Route-Reflector, Calico-node, ExtIP announce for multi-rack deployment of Kubernetes.

Container should be run with network=host.

When container started, ENV should contains:
```
ETCD_AUTHORITY=https://127.0.0.1:2379/,https://10.0.0.1:2379/
HOSTNAME=svasilenko-01-001
RACK=1
BGPD_MODE=RR  # may be RR or NODE (default)
IP=10.222.1.1
DEBUG=1
```
